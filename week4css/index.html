            <h2>Self Portrait</h2>
            <p>This is my first self portrait I ever did using Adobe Illustrator. I was inspired <br>
                by Lois Mailou Jones painting “Initiation, Liberia”. Many of her artwork<br>
                reflected the influences of African history and culture so I took my own spin<br>
                on it by incorporating some components, patterns and design elements <br>
                that best represented me and my own cultural heritage into my portrait.

            <h2>Package Design</h2>
            <p>For this project, I was tasked to redesign a package box of an existing skin<br>
                care product.This is the template of the package rebrand for the Daisy Marc<br>
                Jacobs perfume created using Adobe Illustrator. I wanted to rebrand it into <br>
                a more natural and vintage look compare to its original simplistic and <br>
                repetitive design by changing up the coloring and styling.

            <h2>Mood Board</h2>
            <p>In this project, I created a vision board for 2022 using Adobe Photoshop as<br>
                a way to manifest our goals and visions in a visual way. In my vision board, <br>
                I filled it with images that represent my future goals including things I <br>
                want and want to achieve for the year.
